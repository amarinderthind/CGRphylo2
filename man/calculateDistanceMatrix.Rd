\title{Calculate pairwise distance matrix for multiple sequences}
\usage{
calculateDistanceMatrix(freq_matrices, distance_type = "Euclidean")
}
\arguments{
\item{freq_matrices}{List. A named list of frequency matrices, one per sequence,
as returned by cgat().}

\item{distance_type}{Character. Type of distance to calculate:
"Euclidean" (default), "S_Euclidean", or "Manhattan".}
}
\value{
Numeric matrix. A symmetric distance matrix with sequence names as
  row and column names.
}
\description{
Computes a full pairwise distance matrix from a list of CGR frequency matrices.
}
\details{
This function calculates all pairwise distances between sequences based on
their CGR frequency matrices. The resulting distance matrix can be used for
phylogenetic tree construction, clustering, or other downstream analyses.

# Assuming freq_matrices is a list of frequency matrices

                                       distance_type = "Euclidean")
