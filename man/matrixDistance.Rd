\title{Calculate distance between two CGR frequency matrices}
\usage{
matrixDistance(matrix1, matrix2, distance_type = "Euclidean")
}
\arguments{
\item{matrix1}{Numeric matrix. First CGR frequency matrix.}

\item{matrix2}{Numeric matrix. Second CGR frequency matrix.}

\item{distance_type}{Character. Type of distance to calculate. Options are:
\itemize{
  \item "Euclidean" (default): Standard Euclidean distance
  \item "S_Euclidean": Squared Euclidean distance
  \item "Manhattan": Manhattan (city block) distance
}}
}
\value{
Numeric. The calculated distance between the two matrices.
}
\description{
Computes the distance between two CGR frequency matrices using the specified
distance metric.
}
\details{
This function calculates pairwise distances between CGR frequency matrices.
The Euclidean distance is most commonly used, but Manhattan and squared
Euclidean distances are also available for specific applications.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Calculate Euclidean distance between two sequences
dist <- matrixDistance(freq_mat1, freq_mat2, distance_type = "Euclidean")
}
