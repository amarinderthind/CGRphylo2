\title{Save distance matrix in PHYLIP format}
\usage{
savePhylipDistance(filename, distance_matrix, mode = "relaxed")
}
\arguments{
\item{filename}{Character. Output filename (typically .txt or .phy
extension).}

\item{distance_matrix}{Numeric matrix. A square distance matrix with row
and column names corresponding to sequence identifiers.}

\item{mode}{Character. PHYLIP format mode:
\itemize{
  \item "original": Original PHYLIP format (10 character limit for names)
  \item "relaxed": Relaxed PHYLIP format (allows up to 250 characters)
}}
}
\value{
NULL. Writes file as a side effect.
}
\description{
Exports a distance matrix to PHYLIP format for phylogenetic analysis with
various bioinformatics tools.
}
\details{
PHYLIP format is widely supported by phylogenetic software. The original
format limits sequence names to 10 characters, while the relaxed format
allows longer names. The relaxed format is recommended for modern
applications.

\examples{
# Build a small symmetric distance matrix
dist_mat <- matrix(
    c(0.00, 0.12, 0.25,
      0.12, 0.00, 0.18,
      0.25, 0.18, 0.00),
    nrow = 3
)
rownames(dist_mat) <- colnames(dist_mat) <- c("Seq1", "Seq2", "Seq3")

# Save in relaxed PHYLIP format to a temporary file
out <- tempfile(fileext = ".phy")
savePhylipDistance(out, dist_mat, mode = "relaxed")

# Inspect output
writeLines(readLines(out))
