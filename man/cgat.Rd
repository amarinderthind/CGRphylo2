\title{Calculate CGR frequency matrix for a DNA sequence}
\usage{
cgat(k_mer, seq_index, len_trim)
}
\arguments{
\item{k_mer}{Integer. The word length (k-mer size) for frequency calculation.
Typical values range from 4 to 8. Default is 6.}

\item{seq_index}{Integer. The index of the sequence in the global fasta_filtered
object to process.}

\item{len_trim}{Integer. The length to which sequences should be trimmed for
consistent comparison. Usually set to the minimum sequence length in the dataset.}
}
\value{
A matrix containing the frequencies of all possible k-mers for the
  given sequence. The matrix has 4^k rows corresponding to all possible k-mers.
}
\description{
This function computes the Chaos Game Representation (CGR) frequency matrix
for a given DNA sequence at a specified k-mer length. The CGR approach is an
alignment-free method that represents genomic sequences as frequency matrices,
which can then be used for phylogenetic analysis and sequence comparison.
}
\details{
The function creates a frequency matrix based on the CGR algorithm. Each k-mer's
frequency is calculated from the DNA sequence, and the resulting matrix can be
used to compute distances between sequences without requiring sequence alignment.

The CGR method is particularly efficient for large datasets as the computational
cost of adding a new sequence is just one frequency matrix calculation, unlike
multiple sequence alignment where the cost increases quadratically.
