\title{Generate CGR plot coordinates for a DNA sequence}
\usage{
cgrplot(seq_index)
}
\arguments{
\item{seq_index}{Integer. The index of the sequence in the global
fasta_filtered object to plot.}
}
\value{
Matrix with two columns (x and y coordinates) for plotting the CGR.
  Each row represents the position of one nucleotide in the CGR space.
}
\description{
Creates x and y coordinates for visualizing a Chaos Game Representation (CGR)
plot of a DNA sequence. The CGR plot is a 2D representation that reveals
patterns and composition of genomic sequences.
}
\details{
The Chaos Game Representation is an iterative mapping technique that creates
a 2D representation of DNA sequences. Each base (A, C, G, T) is assigned to
a corner of a unit square, and the sequence is plotted by iteratively moving
halfway from the current position to the corner corresponding to the next base.

The resulting plot has fractal properties and reveals sequence composition,
repeats, and other genomic features. Different sequences create distinct
patterns that reflect their underlying genomic structure.

Corner assignments (standard):
\itemize{
  \item A: (0, 0) - bottom left
  \item C: (1, 0) - bottom right
  \item G: (1, 1) - top right
  \item T: (0, 1) - top left
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Generate CGR coordinates for first sequence
cgr_coords <- cgrplot(1)

# Plot the CGR
plot(cgr_coords[,1], cgr_coords[,2],
     main = "CGR Plot",
     xlab = "", ylab = "",
     cex = 0.2, pch = 4)
}
